There was a boy with black hair and brown eyes who liked to do nothing a lot. He was so good at doing nothing that when he was sitting alone on a bench, he managed to forget

 to breath for half a minute and realized how bad doing nothing was exciting. 

While, one day he sits by the river. And he sees there is a plane "swimming" in the river. That is not something you see every day, said the boy.

He decided to get a closer look at the plane. What he saw was not a pleasant site. He saw that the plane was on fire, and that a bunch of sharks were swimming

around the plane. He was horrified, but then he realized that the plane was transporting chicken legs from a factory. Then he was relieved to know that the sharks 

were only eating chicken legs, and not people.


Just when the boy decided to get up and go back to his house, a mysterious man appeared and approached him. 
"I would stay and watch if I were you" said the man. The boy looked up at the man and looked back at the plane. He couldn't believe it. The plane was gone and there was suddenly nothing happening in the river. The man chuckled and tapped the boy on the shoulder. 

The boy, Clark, finally wakes up on the spaceship that he's in. "That was an obscure dream!" he explains on his way to Mars
