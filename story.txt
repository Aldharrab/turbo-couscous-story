There was a boy with black hair and brown eyes who liked to do nothing a lot. He was so good at doing nothing that when he was sitting alone on a bench, he managed to forget to breath for half a minute and realized how bad doing nothing was exciting. 

While, one day he sits by the river. And he sees there is a plane "swimming" in the river. That is not something you see every day, said the boy.
